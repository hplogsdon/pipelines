# Building Big Data Pipelines with Apache Beam

### Note
This is a "rewrite" of the [original book code](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-Big-Data-Pipelines-with-Apache-Beam). I learn best by actually writing the code, so I'm typing the examples out. Copyright is still assigned to Packt and Jan Lukavsk√Ω.
